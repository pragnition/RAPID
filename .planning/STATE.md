# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-10)

**Core value:** Multiple developers using Claude Code can work on the same project simultaneously without blocking each other, with confidence their independent work will merge cleanly.
**Current focus:** Phase 33 - Merge State Schema & Infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 33 of 37 (Merge State Schema & Infrastructure)
Plan: --
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-10 -- Roadmap created for v2.2 (5 phases, 11 requirements)

Progress: [..........] 0%

## Performance Metrics

*Reset for new milestone. See MILESTONES.md for v2.1 metrics.*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent:
- v2.2 roadmap: 5 phases derived from 11 requirements at fine granularity
- Schema+infrastructure before delegation code (prevent schema drift breaking read/write pipeline)
- Documentation phases after all merge pipeline phases (docs reflect final behavior)
- README and technical docs split into separate phases (different audiences, independent deliverables)
- Research Phase 4 (detection invalidation) omitted -- no backing requirement; resume safety improvements deferred

### Pending Todos

None.

### Roadmap Evolution

- v1.0 Core: Phases 1-9.2 (shipped)
- v1.1 UI UX Improvements: Phases 10-15 (shipped)
- v2.0 Mark II: Phases 16-24 (shipped 2026-03-09)
- v2.1 Improvements & Fixes: Phases 25-32 + 27.1 + 29.1 (shipped 2026-03-10)
- v2.2 Subagent Merger & Documentation: Phases 33-37 (in progress)

### Blockers/Concerns

- Claude Code subagents cannot spawn sub-subagents (hard platform constraint) -- shapes MERGE-06 design
- Token cost for 3-agent adversarial review needs monitoring in production use
- Compressed result protocol ~100 tokens/set budget needs empirical validation in Phase 33
