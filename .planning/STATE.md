# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-03)

**Core value:** Multiple developers using Claude Code can work on the same project simultaneously without blocking each other, with confidence their independent work will merge cleanly.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Agent Framework and State Management

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 9 (Agent Framework and State Management)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-03 -- Completed 01-01 (State Management Foundation)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 3%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 5 min
- Total execution time: 0.08 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 1 | 5 min | 5 min |

**Recent Trend:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 9-phase dependency-ordered structure -- foundation first, agent teams last
- [Roadmap]: Agent framework (AGNT-*) and state management (STAT-*) combined into Phase 1 as shared foundation
- [Roadmap]: Context generation (INIT-02/03/04) split from init scaffolding (INIT-01/05) -- different capabilities
- [01-01]: Used proper-lockfile (mkdir strategy) for cross-process atomic locking with built-in stale detection
- [01-01]: State field parser supports both **Bold:** and Plain: formats for STATE.md compatibility
- [01-01]: Node.js built-in test runner (node:test) for zero-dependency test infrastructure

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Custom agents cannot spawn subagents/teams (bug #23506) -- validate spawning pathway in Phase 1
- [Research]: Contract schema design is novel with no reference implementation -- needs prototype validation in Phase 4
